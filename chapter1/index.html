    <p>My preferred coffee of choice would be Cafe Bustelo because of it tastes in comparion to Folgers and Nescafe. Despite Folgers being a childhood favorite of mine, Bustelo has a more distinct flavor compared to other coffee brands. I've tried about six different brands of coffee but to this day Cafe Bustelo still reigns supreme in my opinion. I should add that is the case for both black coffee and coffee with sugar.</p>
